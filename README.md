# california_housing_price_prediction
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for an end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset.

Project Stages
1. Get the Data
Acquire the California Housing dataset, which contains data on housing districts in California. The dataset is available in this repo.

2. Explore and Visualize the Data
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. Utilize Matplotlib and techniques to better understand the features and relationships within the data.

3. Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms
Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure compatibility with machine learning models. Feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and handling other data transformations are performed in this stage.

4. Select and Train a Model
Experiment with different machine learning models, including decision tree, random forest, and regression, to predict housing prices. Evaluate and compare the performance of each model on the training set shows the best model is random forest

5. Fine-Tune Your Model
Optimize the chosen model by fine-tuning hyperparameters and addressing overfitting or underfitting issues. Utilize cross-validation to ensure robust model performance.
